## Project Description:
this project is about Correctly recognize numbers from thousands of images.
These images are numbers that are handwritten and by
"RNN" Implementation We want to recognize these numbers correctly.

## what is rnn in deep learning?
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are a class of neural networks that are helpful in modeling sequence data. Derived from feedforward networks, RNNs exhibit similar behavior to how human brains function. Simply put: recurrent neural networks produce predictive results in sequential data that other algorithms canâ€™t.

## Installation and dataset : 
The library used in this project is Pytorch and the database used is
The popular MNIST database is in a file called train.csv in the input folder
Located with the project.
