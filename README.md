# Computational Intelligence 9901
This repository contains the course contents and final projects of the course **Computational Intelligence** lectured at the University of Guilan in Fall 2020-2021. Note that due to the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), classes are held online through [this](https://ecent.guilan.ac.ir/ "this") link. This course presents an introduction to the methods and algorithms of Computational Intelligence. Topics covered include: soft computing, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Fuzzy logic, evolutionary computing, and swarm intelligence. We will study the structure of famous CI methods, such as ant colony, genetic algorithm, perceptron network, and deep learning.
