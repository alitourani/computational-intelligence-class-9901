#Project name : flappy brid using genetic algorithm
------------

## Description:
this project is about AI learning how to play flappy bird with genetic algorithm.
it starts completely random, having no idea how to do and how the game will operate and after many generations, it starts to slowly learn and get better and figures out the patterns and how to progress further in the level.
it does all the works using a genetic algorithm named **NEAT**

------------


## Installation: 
for running this project you need to install : *NEAT* and *pygame *

for that you have to run these two commands in cmd :

>pip install pygame
>pip install neat-python



------------

## Instructions :
1.  install modules written in installation section
2. Simply run flappy_bird.py and watch an AI start training itself to play the game of flappy bird!

------------

## Best way to understand :
first, play the video
second, read the pdf
and if you still have doubts look at the comments in the source code
